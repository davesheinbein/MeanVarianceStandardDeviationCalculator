# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the boilerplate for the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator).

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Save the test code**: Ensure your unit test code is saved in a file named `test_module.py`.

2. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your `test_module.py` file is located:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

4. **Run the Tests**: Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_module.py
   ```
   or simply:
   ```bash
   python test_module.py
   ```

5. **View Output**: The output will show the results of the tests. If all tests pass, you will see an "OK" message. If any tests fail, the output will indicate which tests failed and provide details about the failure.

### Additional Options

- To run tests with more verbose output, you can use:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest -v test_module.py
   ```

## Notes

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine, as well as the necessary libraries (like NumPy) used in the project.
